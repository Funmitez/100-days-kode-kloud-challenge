🔥 Most Challenging Moments
The Struggles That Made Me Stronger

Day 13: IPtables Configuration - Spent hours debugging firewall rules only to realize they were in the wrong order. Learned that sequence matters!
Day 32: Git Rebase Conflicts - Interactive rebasing with multiple conflicts was brutal. But mastering this made me a Git power user.
Day 45: Dockerfile Debugging - Build failures due to network issues and missing dependencies. Learned to read build output like a pro.
Day 53: Kubernetes Volume Mounts - Permission denied errors everywhere! SELinux and file permissions nearly broke me, but I persevered.
Day 59: Kubernetes Troubleshooting - ImagePullBackOff, CrashLoopBackOff, pending pods - each error required different debugging approaches. This day built my K8s troubleshooting foundation.
Day 77: Jenkins Pipeline Syntax - One wrong bracket broke the entire pipeline. Learned to validate syntax religiously.
Day 98: Terraform VPC Networking - Understanding route tables, NAT gateways, and internet gateways was mind-bending. But finally getting it right felt amazing!
