# Day 13: IPtables Installation and Configuration

## Scenario
The Nautilus security team has asked you to secure one of the servers in Stratos DC using **iptables**.  

Requirements:  
1. Install `iptables` package if not already installed.  
2. Allow only specific traffic (for example: HTTP on port 80, HTTPS on port 443, and SSH on port 22).  
3. Drop all other incoming connections.  
4. Ensure rules persist across reboots.
