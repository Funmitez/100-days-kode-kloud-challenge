# Day 25: Git Branching and Merge (Nautilus Project)

## Scenario
The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository located at `/opt/cluster.git`.  
This repository is cloned at `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster` on the storage server in Stratos DC.  

They requested the following tasks:

1. Create a new branch called `xfusion` from `master`.
2. Copy the file `/tmp/index.html` into the repo.
3. Add and commit the file to the `xfusion` branch.
4. Merge the `xfusion` branch into `master`.
5. Push changes to the origin for both branches.
