Day 31: Restore Stashed Changes in Git

## Scenario
The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository:

/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce

sql
Copy code

One of the developers stashed some in-progress changes in this repository.  

Now they want to **restore the stashed changes with identifier**:

stash@{1}

pgsql
Copy code

After restoring, the changes should be committed and pushed to the origin repository.
