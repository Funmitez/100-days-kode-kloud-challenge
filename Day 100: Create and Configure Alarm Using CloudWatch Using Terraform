Day 100: Create and Configure Alarm Using CloudWatch Using Terraform

Date: December 23, 2025
Overview
THE FINAL DAY! Set up CloudWatch monitoring and alarms.
Key Concepts Learned

CloudWatch metrics
Alarm configuration
SNS topic integration
Monitoring thresholds

Terraform Code
hclresource "aws_sns_topic" "alerts" {
  name = "infrastructure-alerts"
}

resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "email" {
  topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.alerts.arn
  protocol  = "email"
  endpoint  = "devops@company.com"
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "cpu_alarm" {
  alarm_name          = "high-cpu-utilization"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = 2
  metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
  period              = 300
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = 80
  alarm_description   = "This metric monitors EC2 CPU utilization"
  alarm_actions       = [aws_sns_topic.alerts.arn]

  dimensions = {
    InstanceId = aws_instance.web.id
  }
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "disk_alarm" {
  alarm_name          = "low-disk-space"
  comparison_operator = "LessThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = 1
  metric_name         = "DiskSpaceAvailable"
  namespace           = "System/Linux"
  period              = 300
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = 10
  alarm_description   = "Disk space running low"
  alarm_actions       = [aws_sns_topic.alerts.arn]
}
Commands Used
bashterraform init
terraform validate
